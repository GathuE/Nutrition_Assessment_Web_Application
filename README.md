Hi DevOps,

This is a Nutrition Assessment Tool I built while working with a Nutrition Firm as a newbie.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. PHP
5. MySQL(Database)

HOW IT WORKS;

1. Register a Client as the Nutritionist/Dietician.
2. Login to the Web Application (as the Client).
3. Capture the Client's Bio Data (Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Physical Activity Level and special conditions such as Pregnant / Lactating )
4. Select the Client's desired goal (Weight Management / Diabetes Management).
5. Proceed to Calculate the Client's EER(Estimated Energy Requirement) which simply is a value that shows how much energy the client's body needs to sustain itself under the current metabolism.
6. Proceed to Capture the Client's Dietary Intake History (Based on six possible meals taken during the day; Breakfast, Midmorning Snack, Lunch, Mid Afternoon Snack,  Supper and Late Supper Snack).
7. The web apllication then calculates the Client's nutrient intake and prepares a well detailed report comparing the Reference Intakes and the Meal History.
8. The Report can be printed and used to identify an appropriate intervention for the Client's Goal to be achieved.

I built this Web application with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

I know its just a prototype, and I'm seeking for collaboration to buid it on modern technologies and as a part of a greater project.
